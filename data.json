These tasks include:\n\n- The creation of remote working directories. These directories typically have names that seek to avoid conflicts with other simultaneously running similar workflows. Such tasks use a job prefix of `create_dir`.\n- The stage-in of input files before any task which requires these files. Any file consumed by a task needs to be staged to the task if it does not already exist on that site. Such tasks use a job prefix of `stage_in`. If multiple files from various sources need to be transferred, multiple stage-in jobs will be created. Additional advanced options permit control of the size and number of these jobs, and whether multiple compute tasks can share stage-in jobs.\n- The original compute task is concretized into a compute job in the DAG. Compute jobs are a concatenation of the job's **name** and **id** attribute from the input Abstract Workflow file.\n- The stage-out of data products to one or more output sites. Data products with their **stageOut** flag set to `false` will not be staged to the output sites. However, they may still be eligible for staging to other, dependent tasks. Stage-out tasks use a job prefix of `stage_out`.\n- If compute jobs run at different sites, an intermediary staging task with prefix `stage_inter` is inserted between the compute jobs in the workflow, ensuring that the data products of the parent are available to the child job.\n- The registration of data products in an output replica catalog. Data products with their **register** flag set to `false` will not be registered.\n- The clean-up of transient files and working directories.

The compute site is passed to pegasus-plan using the `--sites` option.\n\n3. **Staging Site**: A site to which the separate transfer jobs in the executable workflow (jobs with stage_in, stage_out, and stage_inter prefixes that Pegasus adds using the transfer refiners) stage the input data to and the output data from to transfer to the final output site. Currently, the staging site is always the compute site where the jobs execute.\n\n4. **Output Site**: The output site is the final storage site where the users want the output data from jobs to go to. The output site is passed to pegasus-plan using the `--output` option. The stageout jobs in the workflow stage the data from the staging site to the final storage site.\n\n5. **Input Site**: The site where the input data is stored. The locations of the input data are catalogued in the Replica Catalog, and the pool attribute of the locations gives us the site handle for the input site.\n\n6. **Workflow Execution Directory**: This is the directory created by the create dir jobs in the executable workflow on the Staging Site.

Several configuration options exist to deal with the dynamics of push and pull of data. In many use-cases, some form of external access to or from the shared file system visible to the application workflow is required for successful data staging. For clouds supporting data storage servers, Pegasus can support workflows requiring two-step staging: first to a data server in the remote site's DMZ, then to the worker node where the job runs. Pegasus can plan both normal staging to the site's data server and worker-node staging as part of the job."

To enable HTCondorC submission to a site with Pegasus, users need to associate the pegasus profile key 'style' with the value 'condorc' in the site catalog. If the remote HTCondor pool doesn't have a shared filesystem, users should use Pegasus in the HTCondorIO data configuration.

Marking files as checkpoints using the workflow API, e.g., job.add_checkpoint(File('saved_state.txt')).\n2. Using the Pegasus profile 'checkpoint.time' to specify when pegasus-kickstart should send a SIGTERM to the running executable, prompting it to write a checkpoint file.\n3. Setting 'maxwalltime' to determine when a KILL signal will be sent.\n4. For long-running jobs, users can periodically save checkpoint files by intentionally killing and restarting the job, controlled by the 'dagman.retry' property.\nWhen using 'condorio' data staging, an empty checkpoint file must be created and referenced in the replica catalog before submitting the workflow."

Key points about staging sites:\n1. Currently, the staging site is always the compute site where jobs execute.\n2. It's used by transfer jobs with stage_in, stage_out, and stage_inter prefixes that Pegasus adds using transfer refiners.\n3. In shared filesystem setups, the staging site is the same as the execution site.\n4. The staging site can be specified using the '--staging-site' option when running pegasus-plan."

        "instruction": "How does Pegasus handle data flow in a Non Shared Filesystem setup?",
        "response": "In a Non Shared Filesystem setup, the data flow is as follows:\n1. Stagein Job executes to stage input data from Input Sites to a workflow-specific execution directory on the staging site.\n2. Compute Job starts on a worker node and transfers input data from the staging site to a local directory using pegasus-transfer.\n3. The compute job executes on the worker node.\n4. Output data is pushed from the worker node to the staging site using pegasus-transfer.\n5. Stageout Job executes to transfer output data from the staging site to the final output site.\nThis setup uses PegasusLite wrappers for compute jobs and is useful for cloud environments without shared filesystems."

For the compute site with a shared filesystem, add a shared-scratch directory pointing to a directory on the shared filesystem.\n3. Enable symlinking by setting 'pegasus.transfer.links' to 'true'.\nThis setup allows:\n- Use of PegasusLite wrappers for jobs, enabling integrity checking and container launches.\n- Symlinking of input data from the shared filesystem directory.\n- File copying of outputs from local worker node directories back to the shared filesystem.\n- Proper mounting of shared filesystem directories when using application containers."

        "instruction": "How does Pegasus handle worker package staging into containers?",
        "response": "When a job runs in an application container, Pegasus handles worker package staging as follows:\n1. By default, PegasusLite scripts automatically download appropriate worker packages for both the host OS and container OS.\n2. To disable automatic downloads (e.g., for nodes without internet access), set 'pegasus.transfer.worker.package=true' and 'pegasus.transfer.worker.package.autodownload=false'.\n3. Specify a worker package for a site in the Site Catalog.\n4. For most Linux flavors, the same worker package should work on both host and container OS.\n5. In the script invoked in the application container, strict checking of worker package versions is always disabled.\nThis approach allows for flexibility in environments with limited internet access or when optimizing to reduce downloads from the Pegasus website."

Installed: Only uses INSTALLED type entries, never transferring executables.\n2. Staged: Only uses STAGEABLE type entries, always preferring staged executables.\n3. All: Uses both STAGEABLE and INSTALLED entries, constructing a map as a cartesian product of matches.\n4. Submit: Only uses STAGEABLE entries residing at the submit host, useful for using the latest compute code from the submit host.\nUsers can specify the mapper using the 'pegasus.catalog.transformation.mapper' property.

Using character classes:\n   rc.add_regex_replica(\"local\", \"file_[a-z]\\.dat\", \"/data/[0]\")\n   This matches files like file_a.dat, file_b.dat, etc.\n\n3. Using quantifiers:\n   rc.add_regex_replica(\"local\", \"log_\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}\\.log\", \"/logs/[0]\")\n   This matches files like log_2024-06-26.log\n\n4. Grouping and backreferences in the PFN:\n   rc.add_regex_replica(\"local\", \"(\\w+)_(\\d+)\\.data\", \"/data/[1]/file_[2].data\")\n   For a file named temperature_001.data, this would map to /data/temperature/file_001.data\n\n5. Catch-all pattern (use as the last entry):\n   rc.add_regex_replica(\"local\", \".*\", \"/data/misc/[0]\")\n\nRemember:\n- Patterns follow Java regular expression syntax.\n- Use ^ and $ to anchor patterns to the start and end of the filename if needed.\n- The [0] in the PFN refers to the entire matched filename, while [1], [2], etc. refer to captured groups.\n- Order matters: more specific patterns should come before more general ones."

        "response": "Set the is_stageable parameter to True when creating a Transformation object. For example: Transformation('myapp', pfn='/path/to/executable', is_stageable=True).
